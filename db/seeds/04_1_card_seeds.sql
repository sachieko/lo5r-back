  A character can withdraw from a clash after one or more rounds of participating without it being dishonorable, as the challenge was answered. Another character can "cut in" to a clash by issuing their own challenge on a participant, which has them take the place of their target''s opponent. Any other interruption by another character has both them and the character they helped lose 10 honor.
  When both characters have taken their turn in the clash, they may choose to extend it after if both are still able. If both choose to extend the clash, they skip their turns in the skirmish to clash at the end of the next round otherwise the clash ends and they resume their skirmish turns.
  If a character is incapacitated, unconscious, dying, or dead then they have lost the clash and the other is the victory. The allies of the losing participant all gain 3 strife as a result.' -- Desc
