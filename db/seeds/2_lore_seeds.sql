-- 1: Bushido
('Bushido', 
'Bushido is the moral code of the Samurai, translated as "The way of the warrior" from Japanese. Rokugan uses the virtues as defined by Nitobe Inazou in the Meiji Period. While they are held up as the code to live by in Rokugan, samurai are still human and such lofty ideals often come at the expense of personal ideals or desires. Every samurai has moments where they may faulter. 
The tenets of Bushido are: Compassion, Courage, Courtesy, Duty and Loyalty, Honor, Righteousness, and Sincerity. 
In the game of Legend of the Five Rings, samurai gain or lose honor on the basis of this code. An eighth tenet of Self Control (Jisei) is also defined by Nitobe Inazo, and while not explicit in Rokugani bushido it is still nonetheless important. Typically, a trifling breach or sacrifice of a tenet of bushido would lose or gain 1 honor. Minor breaches and sacrifices change equal to your rank, while major ones change equal to twice your rank in honor, and massive breaches change at a rate of 3 times your rank.',

-- 2: Koku / Currency
('Koku', 'Koku is one of the main currencies in Rokugan, and represents abstractly the amount of rice it would take to feed a peasant for 1 year. In reality, this is often loosely defined and based on the harvest so koku can fluctuate in worth based on how the harvest is that year. There are also bu and zeni, which are smaller denominations.
The value of the currency often fluctuates as each clan mints its own coins to represent the stores of rice they have, and depending on the harvest this can cause the value to fluctuate which leads to a volatile market at times. This does mean that if you want to get your bushels of rice for your koku, you would have to find a store of rice which is owned by the clan who minted that koku. If those stores are rare in a region, it can devalue the koku theoretically as it is hard to be exchanged. Not that most samurai participate in the market avidly.',
