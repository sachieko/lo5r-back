-- This table must be created after ALL other tables, as its schema and seeds depends explicitly on ALL other tables
-- Rename file if file order is incorrect and this causes issues in the DB!

-- Pagelinks FAQ
-- All keywords must be in square brackets, matching the capitalization of the keyword to use.  
-- ie: [This Will Be a Link]
-- The frontend relies on parsing square brackets for links, but by being opinionated this can be standardized.
-- 
-- Pagelinks created at the end of this file are reserved for 'close enough' to the title or name of a keyword,
-- or for categories that may link to a general page such as all Kiho, or all Weapons, etc.
