# LO5R Backend Server v1.3.1

This navigates the backend interactions with the database for the [lo5r-app front end](https://github.com/sachieko/lo5r-app) using Typescript and an Express server with Postgres SQL.

To install and run, make sure you are using node v23.6.1 which is the current version as of developing this app. 

Then use `npm i` to install dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the server. `npm start` should do the same.

## Server Deploy

You will need a postgres database, as some of the SQL syntax is specific to postgres and is slightly different for MySQL, etc.


## DB Schema

The `database.dbml` file included is out of date ever since the emergency migration of the backend and it's a very low priority to update it right now. 

## Using the API

This server acts as a RESTful API server, such that resources like weapons can be requested at and endpoint like `../weapons/` and specific weapons can be requested by id by using `../weapons/:id`
